​Welcome to my rock pack, which contains over 500 unique rocks!

There is 16 unique low poly rocks, with a total of 36 unique textures! That will add up to a total of 576 unique rocks. There are also 36 planes included, coming to a total of 612 unique prefabs! The textures are atlased into biomes. ie arid, mossy, sand, and snow environments are atlased together, for a total of 9 seperate atlases, optimizing performance, and reducing draw calls.

The rocks are 26 - 48 triangles, making them extremely low poly. The textures were generated using Krita and Blender. The atlases were created using GIMP. If you'd like to see how I made these rocks, and the whole process on making them game ready, check out my YouTube video here: https://youtu.be/wADu1APYkmI
